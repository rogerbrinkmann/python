490   Two decades later, in September 1939, World 
War II started with the invasions of Poland by 
Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (as part of 

the MolotovŒRibbentrop Pact). More than six 

million Polish citizens died in the war. In 1944, 

a Soviet-backed Polish provisional government 

was formed, which, a˜er a period of con˚ict, 

falsi˛ed referendum and elections, gave rise to 

a satellite state of the Soviet Union, Polish Re
-public (Rzeczpospolita Polska), renamed to the 

People™s Republic of Poland (Polska Rzeczpos
-polita Ludowa) in 1952. During the Revolutions 

of 1989, Poland™s Marxist-Leninist government 
was overthrown and Poland adopted a new 

constitution establishing itself as a democracy 

under the name Rzeczpospolita Polska, o˜en 

referred to as the ﬁ˝ird Polish Republicﬂ (III 

Rzeczpospolita).
Despite the vast destruction the country expe
-rienced during World War II, Poland managed 

to preserve much of its cultural wealth. ˝ere 
are 14 heritage sites inscribed on the UNESCO 

World Heritage and 54 Historical Monuments 

and many objects of cultural heritage. Since 

the end of the communist period, Poland has 

achieved a ﬁvery highﬂ ranking in terms of hu
-man development.
Poland, o˙cially the Republic of Poland, is a 
country in Central Europe bordered by Germa
-ny to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia 

to the south; Ukraine and Belarus to the east; 
and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast (a Rus
-sian exclave) and Lithuania to the north. ˝e to
-tal area of Poland is 312,679 square kilometres, 

making it the 71st largest country in the world 
and the 9th largest in Europe. With a popula
-tion of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 

34th most populous country in the world, the 
sixth most populous member of the European 

Union, and the most populous post-commu
-nist member of the European Union. Poland is 

a unitary state divided into 16 administrative 
subdivisions.
Many historians trace the establishment of a 
Polish state to 966, when Mieszko I, ruler of a 

territory roughly coextensive with that of pres
-ent-day Poland, converted to Christianity. ˝e 

Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025, and in 
1569 it cemented a longstanding political associ
-ation with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by sign
-ing the Union of Lublin, forming the PolishŒLith
-uanian Commonwealth. ˝e Commonwealth 
gradually ceased to exist in the years 1772Œ1795, 
when the Polish territory was partitioned among 

Prussia, the Russian Empire, and Austria. Poland 

regained its independence (as the Second Polish 

Republic) at the end of World War I, in 1918.

492493The Early Days
1972  Preparing for the underground mission in Warsaw
1974  Mission started. True Father visits Poland
1977  Translation of Divine Principle - Visit to France
Janusz M went to France in 1972. He was a 
strong catholic and a friend of a catholic priest 
Jan Twardowski, who asked him to gather in
-
formation about new religious groups in order 

to understand why they could ˛nd so many 

followers in western Europe. As a result Janusz 

met also missionaries from the Uni˛cation 

Movement and participated in many seminars 

and workshops. A˜er a few months of careful 

studying and investigating the Divine Prin
-
ciple, he found answers to the fundamental 

questions he had and recognized that the Di
-
vine Principle is the unquestionable truth. Dur
-ing his stay in France and in the United States 
Mission Butter˚y started in 1978 with former 
Austrian national leader Peter Koch having a 

very special experience. While deep in prayer 

Peter received the message from spirit world 

that ‚thousands and thousands of people are 

waiting behind the Iron Curtain in the commu
-
nist countries™. ˝e words he received marked 

the beginning of a project to make preparations 

for the mission in Eastern Europe, the part of 

Europe that at that time was still behind the 

Iron Curtain. Peter saw a very clear goal: his 

task was to make sure that, once the Iron Cur
-tain fell, the mission of the Uni˛cation Church 

would already be established in the East Euro
-
pean countries. 
By the end of 1979 Austrian members were 
asked if any of them would be ready to study 

an East European language. Some of them were 

selected to start the so-called underground 

‚Mission Butter˚y™. For Poland three sisters 

were assigned. ˝eir ˛rst task was to learn the 

language of the country to which they were as
-
signed. ˝e second task was to ˛nd a way to re
-
main in the communist nation of their assign
-
ment and to make a living there, which was a 

more di˙cult task. 
In Poland Martha Kral (née Rainer) went to 
Cracow in 1980. Her husband Christophorus 

would join her quite a number of years later, in 

1986. Missionaries Helga and Hildegard came 

in 1981 and went to Warsaw at ˛rst. Hildegard 

later moved to Torun, while Helga stayed in 

Warsaw. Underground mission in that time 

meant not only to be underground in the com
-
munistic country.
˝e mission in Poland started on the 4th Oc
-tober 1974. ˝e ˛rst member of the Uni˛cation 

Movement in Poland was Janusz™s wife and then 

her friend Zo˛a Korzeniewska. A˜er two years 

of witnessing the year 1976 was very fruitful.  

New members of the Uni˛cation Church in Po
-
land became Krzysztof Gago, Bogumiˇa Bem, 

Joanna Ksyciˆska, Lucyna Piˇka and Janusz™s 

mother-in-law. All the members in Poland at 

that time had young hearts, full of faith and en
-
thusiasm, they were convinced that they were 

able to overcome communism, bring about the 
˝e translation of the Divine Principle and a 
study guide was ˛nished in 1977. ˝ere were 

eight Polish members, as in Noah™s family. 

˝anks to incredible protection of Heavenly 

Parent and 40-day indemnity conditions they 

all received passports and crossed the border of 

the ‚iron curtain™. ˝ey went to France taking 

with them the Divine Principle translated into 

Polish. ˝ey received a lot of help from French 

brothers and sisters.
Janusz was preparing himself to start his mis
-
sion in Poland, which was at that time occupied 

by a communist regime. True Father signed a 

copy of the Divine Principle for Janusz and told 

him that the Heavenly Parent su˘ers because of 

three problems: communism, Christianity and 

the immorality of young people. Also True Fa
-
ther told him that if he wants to be a missionary 

in Poland, he must be a living martyr and to 

take responsibility not to die in prison and to 

have power to protect others. True Father suf
-
fered a lot because of the imprisonment of mis
-
sionaries in the Czechoslovakia and the death 

of Maria Ziwna.
It also meant to go underground in one™s own 
country, one™s own hometown and one™s own 

church environment. ˝is was for the safety 

of the mission and the missionaries. It meant 

˛rst of all that the missionaries had to deny in 

front of their families that they still belonged 

to the Uni˛cation Church. But also in front of 

their friends and their brothers and sisters in 

the church they had to act as if they had broken 

with their faith and the Uni˛cation Church.
 For most of them this was a painful situation. 
For such a mission there was no paved road yet. 

˝ey had to count on their prayers, heavenly 

guidance and protection and their own wis
-
dom. ˝ere were several conditions to be faced. 

First of all: be ready to sacri˛ce your physical 

life. Next: deny being a member of the Uni˛
-
cation Church. Next: you have to be strong 

enough to survive, physically and spiritually, 

in a more or less hostile environment. And last 

but not least: they could meet a situation of not 

even being able to receive the Holy Blessing. 
But this did not happen thanks to the grace of 
our True Parents. In the beginning the Austrian 

underground missionaries did not even know 

of one another™s existence. In the year 1981 all 

missionaries were matched by picture by True 

Father in Camberg, Germany, and in October 

1982 they received the Holy Blessing in Korea, 

also by picture. A˜er the Blessing the mission

aries™ spouses had to go underground too, and 

needed to prepare their own foundation in 

order to join their partners who were already 

working behind the Iron Curtain.
rebirth of Christianity and bring young people 

to God. Janusz used to say that each victory 

must be paid for by indemnity conditions and 

deep prayer. ˝e Polish members felt that their 

unity could protect them. Many years later they 

found out that True Father really took care of 

them. True Father had visited Poland in 1974 

and lived as a tourist in the Victoria hotel in 

Warsaw. He prayed a lot for the Polish mem
-
bers and the Polish nation, he made incredible 

conditions for missionaries working behind the 

ﬁiron curtainﬂ.
Polish members came back to Poland in two 
groups: the ˛rst one a˜er three months and the 

second one a˜er six months. ˝ey were able 

to smuggle many publications and books to 

Poland; they also gained precious experiences 

of witnessing and fundraising. Polish brothers 

and sisters wanted Poland so much to become 

a free country as France was. Also in 1977 the 

construction work for an education center in 

Izabelin, a village near Warsaw, began.

1981  Prayer conditions against threat of Soviet invasion
Bogumiˇa Bem brought the book ‚Victory 
over Communism™ to Poland. ˝e visit to France 
made them stronger, they could feel their value 

and responsibility and knew how to avoid be

ing arrested. ˝e construction of the witnessing 

center in Izabelin that was started in the spring 

of 1977 continued slowly but surely. But it was 

not until the end of 1981 that it could be opened 

and used for the ˛rst time. ˝anks to the great ef
-
forts of our sister Lucyna Piˇka-Clark the mem
-
bers were able to get building materials. God 

gave them a lot of joy because in October 1979 

a new sister joined the Polish Movement  - Bar
-bara Pitkowska-Stacy. In the same year Janusz 

M. decided that during the next years, until 
In October 1981 the witnessing center in Iz
-abelin was almost ready to move in. Because 

there was a growing threat of Soviet troops 

invasion they received a special prayer which 

should help against communism and they said 

it three times a day. True Parents helped the 

Solidarity movement in Poland and also the 

Polish Uni˛cation Movement received money 

for clothes and food.  Mrs. Kim gave them 12 

stones from Pusan for the protection of 12 peo
-
ple in Poland. ˝e Solidarity movement had al
-
ready 9 million members, the hope for victory 

was really big. Finally, on the 13th December 

1981 martial law  and curfew were introduced 

in Poland. Most Solidarity leaders were either 

arrested or interned. 
At that time Polish brothers and sisters bless

our members climbed the highest mountains in

Polish peak Œ Rysy - during winter time. While

houses as their headquarters. Miraculously 
Polish members were able to hide all the pub

lications, either burying them in the ground or 

leaving them at their friends™ homes.  
In spite of the martial law Polish members 
didn™t give up the idea  of going around the ter
-ritory of Poland. Because fuel was distributed 

with special coupons, they couldn™t go by car 

and so they decided to cycle. With much di˙
-
culty they somehow got enough bikes and one 

moped. It was the summer of 1982. ˝e par
-ticipants of the tour were Janusz  M., his wife, 

Joanna Ksyciˆska, Barbara Pitkowska-Stacey 

and Krzysztof Gago. ˝ey enjoyed God™s pro

the night. A˜er coming back the Polish mem

On October 14th  1982  six people from Poland 

were blessed. None of them could go to Seoul, 

only their small pictures were sent there.

Austrian missionary Helga who had many 
friends in the Polish political underground and 
the labor union ‚Solidarity™, later received an 

award for her e˘orts in the cooperation between 

Austria and Poland. Erwin and his wife Hilde
-
gard became the national leaders of Po
 land for 
one year. Later on Hildegard supported the mis
-
sion of her husband as director for East Europe 

wholeheartedly. ˝e most blessing in terms of 

mission activity of the Austrian mis
 sionaries 
came in the city of Cracow. 
Many miracles happened and the protection 
and guidance of God could be felt time and time 

again. Missionary Martha Kral was able to stay 

in Cracow through language and cultural stud
-
ies at the Jagiellonian University, and later she 

also studied history. Martha led a very lonely life 

for years and o˘ered much ﬁjeong-seongﬂ dur
-ing that time. She laid many conditions through 
praying and studying and did a lot of fasting. 

In the year 1984 alone she fasted for more than 

100 days. O˜en she did her prayers during long 

prayer marches and she also o˘ered conditions 

of Divine Principle reading and other ‚hoon dok 

hwae™ conditions. She carried the pain and be
-cause of her sacri˛ces and in spite of her some
-times desperate feelings, she eventually could 
teach the Principle to several young Polish men. 
However, it was a sister who joined in 1986 
as the ˛rst member. Mariola was Martha™s ˛rst 

spiritual daughter in Poland, and with her a 

door was opened for many  more brothers and 
sisters to come. Until the end of 1989 there 

were twelve members. ˝e  ˛rst seven days™ 

workshop, that was held in a small center  in 

1988, was followed by many other workshops. 

˝e witnessing mainly took place on the  stu
-
dent campus. Most of the young members were 

students. Until the end of 1989 twelve dedicat
-
ed  and intelligent young brothers and sisters 

had joined.
Martha remembers: ‚In 1979 I was 23 years 
old and since three years my heart and life were 

connected with God and the True Parents. 

During a period of fundraising in Belgium and 

Holland I had a dream in which I was told to 

leave the Church and go underground  to com
-
munist Poland, more exactly to Cracow. Many 

things were shown to me in this dream. It 

was unimaginable, but three months later this 

dream became reality, when Rev. Peter Koch 

was looking for volunteers to enter communist 

countries. For several years it became a time of 

intense loneliness, great challenges and being 

ready to put one™s life on the line in overcom
-
ing all kind of fears and pressures. We had to 

overcome these in order to build up a founda
-
tion on which God, our Heavenly Parent, could 

work and people could be taught the word of 

the living God in the days of the Lord of the 

Second Advent. Looking back, I can say my 

underground years were the most intense and 

precious experiences of my life, for which I am 

eternally grateful™.

1985  Krzysztof Gago on a secret mission in Moscow
July 1984 was the time of the next tour around 
Poland, which was dedicated for the rebirth of 
Christianity. Polish members cooperated with 

churches, helped priests and religious people. 

˝ey visited the 120 most important churches 

in Poland, prayed a lot and gave Divine Princi

ple lectures. It was a very di˙cult time for Po

land and the world. Communists kept attack

of Pope John Paul II who came from Poland, 

also the assassination attempt of US president 

Ronald Reagan. In Po

1981  Start of the ‚Noah™s Ark Mission™
In the beginning of 1983 Polish brothers and 
sisters organized help for the underground par
-ty ‚Solidarity™. ˝ey managed to collect 1000 lit
-ers of fuel so that famous Polish actors could 
travel around Poland and visit the people who 

were interned in special camps. At that time 

Polish members organized again a 40-day con
-dition of going around the territory of Poland. 
˝ey prayed and lectured in 120 places where 

the communists had laid their strongest foun
-dations, and also in the birthplaces of commu
-nist leaders. ˝ey understood how important 
the patriotic principles ‚God, honor and father
-land™ were for Poles. 
˝e communist ideology and the government 
actions were treated like ‚red ˚ood™. ˝e ‚Noah™s 

Ark Mission™ was started. ˝e members built a 

big black tent in which they could stay for the 

night and hide their white car ˛t for ten people. 

˝e main 40-day condition was made to pre
-
vent the Polish army from attacking Polish peo
-
ple and to prevent Soviet troops from entering 

the territory of Poland. Polish members broke 
the regulations connected with the martial law 

and they did not register in the places where 

they stayed for the night. ˝ey spent nights in 

forests close to military training grounds. ˝ey 

visited 44 places that had the historical ferry 

crossings. ˝ey entered ferries with the car in 

which they had the tent called ‚Noah™s Ark™. At 

that time Polish brothers and sisters talked a 

lot with young people, who were full of cour
-age and power, trying to give them hope. All 
that was possible thanks to God and dedicated 

people, who didn™t betray the Polish members. 

A˜er this tour the martial law in Poland was 

abolished, which made Polish brothers and sis
-ters extremely happy. ˝ey gained hope that 
then they would be able to do much more for 

God in Poland.
In October 1983 Poland was visited by a group 
of Japanese people who were supposed to write 

a report whether the rights of workers and po
-
litical prisoners were not violated in Poland. 

One of the assistants of that group was Haruyo 

Yamashita, who, one year a˜er the blessing, was 

able to meet her husband, Krzysztof Gago.

-cow in 1987 a wider foundation could be built. 
With his investment a farmhouse was pur
 chased 
in 1988 in the village of Glanow, near Cracow. 
It had 4,5 ha of land surrounding it. With the 

masculine energy of our brothers, es
 pecially of 
Stanislaw Glowacki and Jacek Czyszczon, the 

farmhouse was gradually turned into a beau
-
tiful training center. Many other brothers and 

sisters supported this project physically, spirit
-
ually and ˛nancially. 
Martha Kral remembers: ‚Reconstructing 
and building this training center was really a 

big deal, not only moneywise but even more 

because of the energy of total investment and 

sacri˛c
 es needed for it. Back then, at the end of 
the eighties, it was very di˙cult to buy materi
-
als. In order to get them we needed to do a lot of 

‚jeong seong™ and a lot of physical and spiritual 

investment. Our brothers Stanislaw (nick name 
Staszek) and Jacek Czyszczon (nickname Ja
-centy) were the main responsible people there 
and they worked really hard. Staszek was the 

technician and Jacenty organized the materials, 

the food and he did the cooking. ˝is was an 

amazing job. People who did not experience 

life under communism at that time cannot fully 

understand the meaning of this. 
Martha: ‚Just one example: At some point we 
needed to buy a refrigerator, but you could not 

buy it just like that. A˜er ˛nding a shop that 

o˘ered one we had to stand in a queue for three 

full days and nights (taking turns), to get this 

refrigerator. All of us had such an in
 credible 
motivation to work for God™s provi
 dence, in 
the awareness that True Parents were living on 

the earth. We were ready to pour our life ener

experienced so much joy™.

 cian, had the responsibility for the con
-struction site and the entire renovation process. 

Every time I visited the construction site he had 

start
 ed a new building or a new ˚oor. His ide
-alism was limitless. I had to organize the mon
-
ey and we always received enough help from 

Heaven to move forward™. 
Christoph: ‚One of our principles was ‚no 
alcohol on the construction site!™, which was 

very unusual at that time in rural communist 

Poland. One evening Staszek found all workers 

drinking vodka and he sent them home imme
-diately, even though he knew that a delivery of 
concrete was scheduled for the next day which 

meant very hard work in the early morning. So 

he went out late at night, knocking on doors 
in the village. As if by miracle he could hunt 

up enough new workers for the early morning 

concrete delivery™. 
In 1989 the ˛rst 7 Day Divine Principle sem
-inar was held in Glanow. Twelve brothers and 
sisters participated in an intense Divine Prin
-
ciple study with a challenging Divine Principle 

test at the end. Before that year, in 1988, the 

training center in Izabelin, which was also built 

with great investment of brothers and sisters, 

was opened for seminars. Since the summer of 

1988 brothers and sisters could also gain fund
-
raising experiences in It
 aly. From that time 
on the education by going through a Formula 

Course was started in the Cracow community. 

˝e eldest brothers and sisters from Cracow 

also participated in in
 ternational workshops 
in Austria, with other young members from 

various East European countries. ˝is was in 

1988 and 1989. Until the end of communism in 

1989 a solid spiritual and material foundation 

was built up, in coopera
 tion with young Polish 
brothers and sisters.

501During the June 1989 elections for the Polish 
Parliament the communist party was complete
-ly defeated. Rev. Kwak came to Poland and held 

a ˛rst meeting of missionaries from Warsaw 

and Cracow. Together with dr. Gordon Ander
-son, international president of PWPA, he met 

Lech Walesa in the headquarters of  the Soli
-
darity labor union in Gdaˆsk. In this meeting 

also Janusz M, Krzysztof Gago, Leszek Sferpel 

and some eminent professors, advisors to Lech 

Wa, participated.
November 9th 1989 was the day of the fall of 
the Berlin wall. Quite soon a˜er that histori
-cal event reverend Kwak, who had taken over 
‚Mission Butter˚y™ a˜er Peter Koch went to the 

spirit world in 1984, visited Poland for the ˛rst 

time. In that same year the underground mis
-sionaries from Warsaw and Cracow also met 
for the ˛rst time and got united in one church, 

centered on Janusz M (with his wife Barbara) 

as the ˛rst national leader of Poland. It was a 

historical and meaningful ˛rst meeting in the 

center of the Warsaw community in Izabelin. 

Two Holy Grounds were established at that 

time, one in Glanow Training Center (Cracow) 

and one in Izabelin center in Warsaw. On No
-vember 19th 1989 True Parents came back from 
Moscow a˜er meeting President Gorbachev
Rev. Kwak suggested in this meeting that 
Poland and South Korea should establish dip
-
lomatic relations. At the end of October 1989 

the Polish chapter of PWPA was created. Its 

˛rst member was Professor Tadeusz Zalewski, 

a distinguished scientist and advisor to Lech 

Wa. PWPA  developed very quickly. No less 

than 44 professors from  the state universities 

in Cracow, Warsaw, Gdaˆsk and Lublin became 

members of PWPA Poland. ˝e quarterly mag
-
azine ‚Science for Peace™ was created by the Pol
-
ish PWPA in Gdansk.
All underground missionaries were invited 
and they could meet their brothers and sisters 

from the western nations for the ˛rst time a˜er 

ten years of separation. 
A˜er the era of communism ended and the 
missionary groups met in Warsaw, about twelve 

highly dedicated and well educated young peo
-
ple from the Cracow community and twelve 

from the Warsaw community became the foun
-
dation for the coming era in Poland. Most of 

them were students or had graduated already 

from their studies. All were beautiful and ener
-getic young people. ˝ey were experienced in 

lecturing, fundraising and in living a God-cen
-
tered life.

503˝e Austrian missionaries understood that for 
mission development also a ˛nancial founda
-tion had to be built up. Christoph Kral, based on 

his experience as a sales representative for print
-
ing machinery, founded a company for the pro
-
duction of screen printing machinery. He did so 

together with a former German client of his. 
˝e name of the company they founded was 
S.M.M. (like Sun Myung Moon). It was a joint 

venture with a German partner, with export of 

machinery and machine parts to Germany. A 

young brother, Jacek M., helped to build up this 

company from the Polish side.
When the company began in 1989 Poland was 
still under communism. ˝ere was great eco
-
nomic instability and hardly any material goods 

could be obtained. So a lot of sweat had to be 

shed to build up a production site like this. 
˝e same situation applied for the construc
-tion of the training center. Without help from 

God and the spirit realm it would have been im
-
possible to build up such a foundation. When 

president Won Pil Kim came to Poland he en
-
joyed his visit to the machine production com
-
pany, as well as to the Polish training center that 

was still under construction, very much.
By the end of 1992 the production company 
S.M.M. was liquidated because of the bankrupt
-
cy of the German partner. ˝ere was a possibili
-
ty to continue the Polish machinery production 

of S.M.M, but Christoph Kral felt exhausted af
-
ter years of working in the business ˛eld. It was 

his desire to work in the witnessing ˛eld and at 

the beginning of 1993 he le˜ for CIS (Russia), 

and from there he went as the ˛rst missionary 

to Armenia. He chose to do this a˜er attending 

True Parents in Kodiak, Alaska.
1989-93  First business foundation started
On January 20th 1990 the Uni˛cation Church 
was o˙cially registered in Poland as ‚Kosciol 

Zjednoczeniowy czyli Ruch pod Wezwaniem 

Ducha Swietego dla Zjednoczenia Chrzesci
-janstwa Swiatowego™.
In 1990 CARP was established as one of the 
˛rst providential organizations in Poland. On 

April 20th the College Association for the Re
-
search of Principles (CARP) was registered in 

Cracow as ‚Akademickie Stowarzyszenia Urzec
-
zywistniania Wartosci Uniwersalnych™. ˝e 

Uni˛cation Movement members were almost 

exclusively students at that time. ˝erefore the 

Church and CARP activities were almost the 

same. A˜er the mobilization of the sisterhood 

nations in March 1993 in Seebenstein, with the 

goal to support the post-communist countries 

in their mission,  three Japanese brothers from 

German CARP came to Cracow, the seat of 

Polish CARP. ˝ey were giving Won Hwa Do 

training  regularly, which brought many inter
-ested students to the centers. 
Students liked it very much because there 
was little opportunity for studying martial arts 

at that time. Shigeki Matsugane, Katsejuki  Ki
-
kuchi and Hiroyaki Yamakawa were the three 

Japanese brothers who worked for several years 

in Cracow, teaching the students not only ˛ght
-ing; they also taught the spiritual mind and 

philosophy behind it, which was very much 

connected with the Principle. Many students, 

especially brothers, came for this activity. One 

of the earliest activities besides Won Hwa Do 

was a rock concert on the student campus. Ag
-
nieszka Pac, Jadwiga K, Bogdan Brzyski and 

many others were working with great enthusi
-
asm on the campus. ˝e eldest members took 

over more and more responsibility and invest
-
ed themselves with a beautiful and pure heart. 

˝ey became good lecturers in Divine Principle 

and in guiding and supporting others.
In August 1990 the Polish CARP participated in 
the European CARP convention in Paris. In 1991 

CARP organized a rally against pornography and 

this event was shown on TV. CARP was spread
-ing purity and moral values, building friendships 
and international cooperation. In addition to 

Won Hwa Do the CARP students organized ac
-tivities for children; and also cleaning mountain 
areas and university buildings. ˝ey did many 

other projects as well - it was a great and exciting 

time. Later, in 1993, summer camps were organ
-ized in the Tatra mountains and exhibitions were 
held. ˝ese exhibitions were visited by several 

thousands of people in Zakopane, a place well-

liked by people from all over the country.

In the early days CARP played an impor

Movement in eastern Europe. In 1992 Chris
-
toph Kral und Malgorzata Bochnia were sent 

as missionaries to Russia to help in the CIS 

providence.  A bit later Christoph started the 

mission in Armenia  with the support of  Mal
-
gorzata. In  the summer of 1993 Polish  CARP 

students (Jadwiga, Bogdan Brzyski, Grzegorz 
Galacki and Piotr Kotowski) were working to
-
gether  in Armenia with brothers and sisters 

from Austria. ˝ey were helping with organiz
-
ing seminars for hundreds of students and pro
-
fessors. ˝ese brothers and sisters gave birth to 

the Armenian movement.  Malgorzata Bochnia 

became the ˛rst national leader in the history 

of the Uni˛cation Movement  of Armenia.

504505At the end of 1989 a pioneering mission was 
started in Gdaˆsk by Krzysztof and Haruyo 
Gago, Renata Kopala and Maria Rochowicz. 

˝ese members were ˛lled with enthusiasm 

and deeply moved by the message of Heung 

Jin Nim. From the year 1984 Heung Jin Nim 

started to transmit messages from spirit world 

through our sister Faith Jones who is a medium. 

He gave words of hope, assuring our members 

that the fall of communism was at hand - and it 

really happened. 
True Father gave directions to announce the 
fall of communism during the PWPA confer
-ence in Geneva in August 1985. Polish mem
-
bers were witnessing and they  showed  great 

faith doing this. A lot of young people became 

members of the Uni˛cation Movement. Two 

witnessing centers were opened, one in Gdaˆsk 

and one in Sopot. ˝e cooperation with pro
-
fessors was very fruitful and CARP underwent 

a rapid development. Polish brothers and sis
-
ters ful˛lled many indemnity conditions. ˝ey 

prayed a lot and also organized public prayers, 

for instance in front of the Polish Communist 

Party Headquarters in Gdaˆsk, and in front of 

the city council building in Gdynia.
Witnessing was going very well and the ˛rst 
CARP center was organized in Gdaˆsk. ˝e 

University of Gdaˆsk made space available for 

the CARP headquarters to be  installed.  ˝e 

foundation for the development was  building 
bridges between students and professors based 

on universal family values. Professors started to 

recognize and respect True Father, especially 

a˜er professor Morton Kaplan™s reports from 

the 1985 Geneva conference.
In the 1990™s Japanese instructors of Won 
Hwa Do and missionaries from Japan, France 

and Scandinavian countries came to Gdaˆsk. 

˝ere were more and more members. ˝anks 

to the help of president Won Pil Kim it was pos
-
sible to rent a large educational center in Gdy
-
nia; there also a Holy Ground was established. 

Members of the Gdansk Polish CARP partici
-
pated in the Berlin demonstration for abolish
-
ing the Berlin Wall. 
˝ere was great unity among brothers and 
sisters, the CARP members and PWPA pro
-
fessors. Guests were very inspired by the Won 

Hwa Do training and Divine Principle lectures. 

A Won Hwa Do demonstration together with 

a performance by the Uni˛cation Movement 

group ‚Blue Tuna™ brought 700 people in a large 

sports™ hall. It was a golden age of witnessing! 

In 1990 many members from Gdaˆsk took part 

in the Paris CARP Convention. ˝e Gdaˆsk re
-
gion actively participated in the development 

of witnessing through CARP, WFWP and Pure 

Love Activity. ˝e next leaders of this region 

became Manuel and Elzbieta Gaspar, Antonio 

and Choo Fiore, Tomasz and Mie Góreccy and 

since 2012 Marek and Adrianna Rudnik.

A˜er the fall of communism - and a˜er the 
uni˛cation of the two underground mission

ary groups in Poland - there were many new 

developments. One of them was that ‚Reli

gious Youth Service™ (RYS) from America ap
-
proached the young Polish movement with the 

idea of holding  a community service project  in 

Poland. It would be the ˛rst time for such a pro
-
ject to take place in a post-communist country. 

˝ree projects were planned in three di˘erent 

places in our country: in Warsaw, near Cracow 

and in the mountain area of Zakopane in South 

Poland. It was planned to take place from June 

26th until August 3rd  1990.

-
er, in March 1990 in Seebenstein Austria, True 

Parents had asked members from Western Eu
-
rope to organize an international mobilization 

of missionaries to o˘er help to develop the 

Eastern European Uni˛cation Church. 
Gerry Young and one more American broth
-er started organizing this great community 
service project - together with the Polish Uni
-˛cation Church. From the Polish side Martha 
Kral was responsible for the projects in South 

Poland and missionaries Helga and Herbert for 

the Warsaw project. ˝e most successful pro
-
ject was near Cracow, in the village Karniowice, 

where participants from all over the world were 

digging a water-pipeline. ˝e whole village was 

very enthusiastic and the project was supported 

by the local o˙cials.
As a result of the Seebenstein meeting mis
-sionaries came to Poland from various Europe
-
an countries. ˝ey came from France, Scandi
-
navia, Germany, and Belgium. 
From 1991 to 1994 about 35 missionaries 
served in Poland thanks to the sisterhood rela
-
tionship between Poland and France. Over the 

years we also  received a lot of help from Japan: 

˛rst from the Japanese WFWP, and later on 

whole groups of  Japanese missionaries came to 

Poland. ˝e Japanese missionaries that came to 

our country helped to develop witnessing, and 
to open pioneer missions in Polish cities as well 

as to strengthen the foundation the Uni˛cation 

Church had in other regions. In 1990 pioneers 

went to Gdansk, Poznan, Wroclaw, Szczecin, 

Rzeszow and young people, most students, 

joined the movement. Korea gave us a lot of 

help also. ˝ey all helped the Polish movement 

to broaden their national foundation. Polish 

brothers and sisters took part in many 2-day 

and 7-day seminars organized in Izabelin and 

Glanów, and also in international 21-day semi
-
nars organized in Glanów and in other Eastern 

European countries.

became regional leader of East Europe. In No

his wife Hildegard. Erwin and Hildegard were 

both born in Austria in 1956, and both joined 

our movement there in 1975. ˝ey were matched 

and blessed in 1982. At that time Hildegard was 

already working as an underground missionary 

in Poland. At the time of the matching Erwin 

did not know that, he could only imagine it.
Erwin writes in his testimony: ‚Whenever we 
met I would tell her a lot about my mission, yet

1992 the Polish chapter of the Women™s Feder

Two hundred people participated in the ˛rst 

national event in the Warsaw Forum Hotel.
˝e key project of the WFWP over the years 
has been organizing ‚Bridge of Peace™ ceremo

reconciliation between former enemies through 

symbolic restitution. ˝is is realized through a 

solemn ritual of asking and giving forgiveness for 

harm done towards the other party in the past. 

During the ceremonies pairs are formed with 

women that come from former enemy nations 

or from di˘erent religious, cultural and racial

recall my ˛nal breakfast at the headquarters of

Another important activity of the WFWP 
over the years has been to organize monthly

Many more seminars followed and guests 
came from a variety of East European nations. 

So the Glanow training center became the 

birthplace for many young members from East 

Europe.
In August 1993 the Ocean Church provi
-dence started in Poland. Earlier that year True 

Father had announced that he wanted forty 

nations to receive four boats each, and Poland 

was one of these nations. ˝ese were the ‚Good 

Go™ boats, designed by True Father himself. ˝e 

idea was to build up ‚Ocean Church™ and a busi
-
ness foundation as a seed foundation for this 

nation. Unfortunately this foundation was lost, 

together with the boats, several years later. 
In October 1993 Patrick Jouan from France

Poland. Good top-level people supported the 
event. For instance president Lech Waˇesa™s wife 

Danuta Walesa sent a warm letter welcoming 

True Mother. And a  another woman from the 

presidential o˙ce came and gave some really 

welcoming words to True Mother. 
ing ceremony was held in Glanow on the same 

day with ten married couples attending. In 1997 

about 18 members applied for the Blessing. Later, 

in the year 2000, ninety Polish participants went 

to the Blessing in Korea and they could also par
-ticipate in the celebration of True Father™s 80th 
birthday. In all later Blessing ceremonies some 

Polish brothers and sisters took part every time.

A very well-known singer sang during the 
meeting in Warsaw. A˜er the performance she 
wanted to go home but her manager, who was 

very inspired by the atmosphere, suggested that 

both of them stay for all of True Mother™s speech. 

A˜er the speech this lady singer said that she 

really wanted to work with the Women™s Federa
-
tion for World Peace. She was thinking of doing 

a charity concert. Mother was very happy about 

this.  ˝ere were about 1000 guests and the hall 

was totally packed.  In the Marriott Hotel there 

were only 700 chairs and we had a 200 capacity 

over˚ow room, but still people were standing. 

So it was a very successful meeting.
Just to note: in November 1992, one year before 
the event in Warsaw, 160 members and guests 

came from Poland, driving a long distance to 

attend True Mother™s speech in Berlin. Mother™s 
visit and talk in Warsaw marked the o˙cial in
-auguration of the Polish chapter of the Women™s 
Federation for World Peace that had been regis
-tered the year before. (A˜er the inauguration of 
the international WFWP in Korea in early 1992 

True Mother made a world tour to o˙cially start 

the WFWP chapters in each nation she visited). 
In 1993 an ACUMI Conference was held in 
Warsaw with Dr. Rubenstein and Rev. Kwak. 

In the same year a conference of the Professors™ 

World Peace Academy (PWPA) and a confer
-ence of the Women™s Federation for World Peace 
were organized in Warsaw. ˝e year 1993 also 

saw the opening of a brand new witnessing 

center on Dluga Street in the old city of Gdansk. 

And on July 18th 1994 the witnessing center 

‚Tamka™ was purchased in Warsaw by the Polish 

Uni˛cation Church.

511True Parents™ visit to Poland opened a new 
chapter of history since True Father was visiting 
Eastern Europe for the very ˛rst time, besides 

his visit to Poland as a tourist in 1974. 
True Parents arrived in Poland™s capital War
-saw on November 6th. On the ˛rst evening Fa
-ther shared his love and heart with Polish broth
-ers and sisters for three hours, giving them deep 
insights into True Love and the responsibility of 

Abel. Earlier that day True Mother met with the 

wife of Poland™s President, Mrs. Danuta Walesa., 

explaining True Father™s mission and her concern 

for mor
 al values in the family. Mother introduced 
the Blessing as a foundation to pave the way for 

sexual purity among young people. True Mother 

o˘ered a special donation for an orphanage which 

was under the honorable patronage of Mrs. Wale
-sa. ˝e First Lady promised her support.
Ifour National Messiah families were 
assigned to Poland. ˝ey were Rev. Sung Kyun 

Moon, Hiroshi and Masuko Yoshida, Amos and 

Beatrice Clyburn and Antonio and Choo Fiore. 

We felt True Father™s great hope for our nation 

as he assigned his direct cousin Sung Kyun 

Moon to be with us. He ascended in February 

2005 and since then we have felt  his presence 

among us very o˜en. We remember his many 

tears of love for our nation and our Uni˛cation 

family. Our national messiahs have shown an 

enduring and persevering life of faith and at
-tendance to Heavenly Parent and True Parents.

˝e next day True Parents went on a sightsee

a thirty minute summary of Polish history given 

by a Polish brother. ˝is was a vivid expression 

of True Parents™ desire to really get to know the 

history and situation of each country. Later that 

evening 1400 guests came to hear Father™s ad

hall that can seat 3000 was only half-full. In this 

di˙cult situation Polish members could expe

a˜er the public event. Father gave an upli˜ing 

sermon to 250 mostly young Polish members 

and explained in a practical way how to improve 

their situation.

people. It opened the way for the next Blessing

to the Blessing in Washington USA on Novem

organized in Poland in the Warsaw Uni˛cation 
Church headquarters on Czardasza Street and 

in Hotel Gromada.

In 2001 ˛˜y Polish patriots were liberated in 
Cheong Pyeong. Among them were kings, mili
-tary commanders and saints from Poland™s past.  

Four years later - in 2001 - many more  Polish 
patriots were liberated in Cheong Pyeong by 

Dae Mo Nim. 
˝e following years were devoted to blessing 
campaigns, attended by members from all Pol
-ish regions. ˝ey all worked very hard, giving 

the Blessing with the support of numerous mis
-sionaries from Japan. 
Groups of Polish members took part in the 
next blessings on the 8th of June 1998 in New 

York, and in 1999 in Seoul, Korea.
In 1999 True Parents initiated the Interna
-tional and Interreligious Federation for World 

Peace (IIFWP). ˝roughout the world and 
throughout Europe conferences devoted to 

building peace through reconciliation between 

religions, races and cultures, and through right 

governance and leadership, were organized. 

Professors from the Polish chapter of PWPA 

participated in these conferences. It created a 

good foundation for establishing the Polish IIF
-WP. Our internal motto for this organization 

was to create a victorious united foundation for 
True Parents™ visit in Poland.
On June 6th 2002 the Polish Uni˛cation 
Movement received substantial ˛nancial sup
-port from True Parents for purchasing a build
-ing to be used as a Peace Embassy. A stylish and 

very useful building was bought. It has a big 
conference hall for about one hundred people, 

a big dining room, seven rooms for guests and a 

smaller conference room for VIP™s.
In June 2002 Dae Mo Nim and some mem
-bers of the Cheong Pyeong sta˘ came to 

Glanow for ancestor liberation on the Euro
-pean level. Dae Mo Nim decided that Poland 

would be the ˛rst country in Europe where the 
following providential events would take place:

1997-2000  More development
2000  Polish chapter of IIFWP was launched
2002  Peace Embassy in Warsaw
a ceremony of asking and giving forgiveness for 

past collective sins. It was a solemn ritual during 

which the mistakes and su˘ering of a common 

past, ˛lled with military con˚icts between the 

two neighboring nations, were addressed. ˝e 

purpose was to make a new start for both nations 

and to create a better common future.
On the 9th of May 1998 WFWP sponsored an 
international conference on ‚Women of the New 

Millennium Bridge of Peace™ in Warsaw. A histor
-ical ‚Bridge of Peace™ ceremony was held between 

women from Poland on one side, and women 
from Russia and Belarus on the other side. 
˝e year 1999 was the beginning of a great 
mobilization for witnessing, led by Mr. Jung 

Duk Bong in Katowice and with the help of 

an international team in Cracow. ˝e result of 

these activities was that a group of 90 people 

from Poland went to the Blessing in Korea in 

February 2000. ˝ey were also able to partici
-pate in the celebration of the 80th birthday of 

True Father. A substantial number of Polish 
VIP™s attended the IIFWP conferences in Korea.
˝e Polish chapter of the IIFWP was launched 
during a conference held in Konstancin Jezi
 orna 
near Warsaw from November 17th to 19th of 

the year 2000. ˝e topic of the conference was 

‚Creating the Culture of Peace: Personality, Fam
-ily and Service for Society™. ˝is event was fol
-lowed by a similar conference in Jachran
 ka near 
Warsaw on December 1st to 3rd 2000. ˝is was 

the ˛rst joint conference of the Polish chapters 

of IIFWP and WFWP. Both conferenc
 es were 
supported by the World Association of NGOs. 

In the following years similar conferenc
 es were 
organized each year; the ˛rst session was always 

a Hoon Dok Hae of True Father™s words.
a 21-day Registration Workshop for blessed 
wives from all over Europe, an Eight Day Reg
-istration Workshop for blessed husbands and 

a  Two Day Workshop for Ancestor Liberation 
and Blessing. In this ancestor liberation about 

2000 members from all over Europe participat
-ed. Up to the present moment many workshops 

and seminars on the European level have been 
organized in this beautiful workshop centre in 

Glanow near Cracow. 
In the previous year 2001 Poland saw another 
change of leadership, when Marek Rudnik suc
-ceeded Mr. Chang Duk Bong and became the 

7th national leader in Poland.

In the year 2003 ecumenical activities were 
developing well and the Uni˛cation Movement 
in Poland had a good cooperation with other 

religions. ˝ere was for example a constructive 

and inspiring cooperation with the Seventh 

Day Adventist Church. ˝e fruit of these ac
-tivities became visible in one very meaningful 

event. ˝is was the one day seminar entitled 
‚˝e World at the Turning Point Œ the Necessi
-In 2003 the program of Middle East Peace In
-itiative (MEPI) was initiated in our country. A 
group of Ambassadors for Peace from Poland 

went to Israel and Palestine. ˝ey participat
-ed in conferences and in a Peace March with 

about 3000 people, among whom were Israeli 
and Pales
 tinians. ˝e culmination of the march 
was the impressive ceremony of the Coronation 

of Jesus as the King of Israel. One day before 

the depar
 ture of this delegation of Polish Peace 
Ambas
 sadors to the Holy Land a March for 
Peace was organized by IIFWP in Warsaw.
In October 2005, just prior to their visit to 
Poland, an exhibition about True Parents™ peace 

initiatives was organized in the historic thor
-oughfare Nowy Swiat Street in the Warsaw city 

centre. As a result of this investment many vis
-itors came to listen to True Father™s speech on 

October 24, 2005. 
In the course of  2006 a second and third exhi
-bition were organized here with the same theme 

and purpose. In 2006, a˜er True Mother™s very 
successful visit to Warsaw, national leader 

Marek Rudnik reported: ‚I am amazed by the 

power of the exhibition! ˝is is the perfect way 

to introduce people to the Interreligious and In
-ternational Federation for World Peace. Going 

through the panels, guests received great inspi
-ration. Even though most guests had heard only 

negative reports about  the ‚Moon sect™ they 
came out inspired. ˝e success of the exhibition 

gave me great hope that we can succeed, even in 

a society as negative as Poland™. 
‚I wish to report one very special situation. 
One Japanese missionary brought an elderly 

man to the exhibition. ˝is man, a retired army 

o˙cer, became so inspired that each morning 

at exactly 11 a.m. he was waiting for us with 

another list of his friends who should become 

Ambassadors for Peace. Altogether he recom
-mended 75 people. Of course the ‚Moon sect™ 

topic came up, so Krzysztof Gago explained to 
him personally and he was at peace.
˝e Coronation Ceremony of True Parents as 
King and Queen of Peace was held in the Peace 

Embassy in Warsaw on November 28th 2004.

A group of 18 Ambassadors for Peace from 
Poland took part in the next pilgrimage to Israel 

and Palestine, and in conferences for the rec

Clergymen from di˘erent religions went on 
the next IIFWP pilgrimages to Israel and Pales

churches, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, 
the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church. 

Also some journalists who wrote about the Is
-raeli-Palestinian con˚ict joined the pilgrimage.
˝e day before True Mother came to Warsaw 
he organized a ceremony with his VIP friends 

in which they o˙cially received the honour of 

being Ambassadors for Peace. Our sister, the 

Japanese missionary, won 12 VIP disciples in 

Poland. What a beautiful o˘ering!™ 
˝e ˛rst breakthrough at the exhibition came 
when we united with president Song in do
-ing Jeong Seong conditions. Many leaders and 

members around the nation joined in fasting 
and night vigils. 
On that foundation our regional leader Mr. 
Takenori Hashimoto could pray a desper
-ate prayer to bring down the blessed spiritual 

world. From that moment everything changed. 
Also each night and morning we prayed that 

those people of Warsaw with a foundation 

to receive the Messiah would be brought by 

their ancestors to Nowy Swiat (meaning New 

World), where we had the exhibition. We were 

certain that the spiritual world was seriously 

mobilized that way. 
Our second generation members also worked 
very hard to bring guests to the exhibition. Our 

two youngest ones, Ayana and Janet (second 

generation national messiahs in Poland), went 

out on the street to bring  guests to the exhibi
-tion. And they did bring guests!

516517Between October 24th and November 21st  
of the year 2005 Europe enjoyed the grace and 
blessing of True Parents™ 100 city world speaking 

tour. In that period True Parents could appreciate 

being received in many European nations more 

warmly, and on a higher level, than ever before. 
During this tour True Parents wanted to ac
-knowledge the European contribution to the 

Providence. ˝ey wanted to meet all of their Eu
-ropean children, get to know them better, share 

their parental heart with them and bestow their 
parental love on them. ˝is grace also came to 

Poland, on October 24th. ˝at day it was our 

turn to receive True Parents and a warm wel
-come and a beautiful venue for True Fathers 

speech were prepared. 
To stage a successful event Poland needed 
considerable help from large numbers of Ger
-man members. ˝ey travelled hundreds of kilo
-metres and spent days and weeks helping to 

prepare a truly memorable event in Warsaw. 
True Father delivered his speech in the Wes
-tin Hotel in Warsaw and more than 700 guests 

attended, with many high level guests among 
them. ˝e morning a˜er the speech we could 

share wonderful Hoon Dok Hae with True Par

A re˚ection from Fritz Piepenburg/Germany 
about the mobilization before and during the 
main event, October 24, 2005, Warsaw, Poland.
True Parents™ party arrived in the morning 
and was smoothly guided to the VIP launch. It 

was a relaxed atmosphere, brightened up by the 

occasional performance of Shin Joon Moon, the 

grandson. Driving to the hotel was smooth - True 

Mother commented on the beautiful sight of the 

colors of the autumn trees. At the hotel, the door 

was widely opened and the elevators were wait
-ing to take the party up to the 20th ˚oor.
Meanwhile brothers and sisters, who were 
not involved in the preparations, continued to 

invite people by way of bringing them to the 

exhibition, which was organized in the center 

of Warsaw in the upper rooms of a well known 

café, dating back to 1866. 
Because of this exhibition, we could crack the 
500 Ambassadors for Peace mark two days be
-fore the event and came very close to the 700 

con˛rmed invitations.
˝en at the event itself, people started to 
stream in ever increasing numbers. Rev Kwak 

and Dr Walsh came to the VIP reception, host
-ing some 50 VIPs from Poland, Germany and 

Holland, being introduced to each one and have 
some meaningful conversation. Meanwhile it 

became clear not everybody would possibly ˛t 

into the hall. Several times the MC had to an
-nounce and ask those families with young peo
-
ple to stand up and empty their seats for our 

guests. ˝e hall had a capacity of 550, but there 
must have been a total of over 700 people. ˝e 

doors at the entrance of the hall could not be 

closed, because people were crowding there and 

standing all along the wall.
Germany could bring some 240 people, Hol
-land a busload of 50. And more people were 

coming in. In fact the hotel management be
-came so worried about the big in˚ux of people 

that at one point they closed the hotel com
-pletely, and let only as many people in as were 

going out. Only towards the end they would al
-low everybody in.

True Mother and Kook Jin Nim™s couple vis
-ited Poland and were very warmly received. 
Kook Jin Nim delivered the speech ‚God™s Ideal 
Family and the Kingdom of the Peaceful, Ideal 

World™ in the Hotel So˛tel Victoria in Warsaw 

on July 2nd 2006. ˝eir visit to our country was 

part of  ‚True Mother™s and True Children™s 180 

Nation Peace Tour™,  of which the European part 

took place from July 1st to 15th 2006. In this 

short and very intense period they visited 15 

nations, one nation per day. 
A˜er her speech True Mother reported to True 
Father by telephone: ‚It was a great, great suc
-cess!™ We in Poland could see that Mother was 

very happy during Hoon Dok Hae. She showed 
this clearly by asking a number of groups to sing. 

She also sang herself and gave a ˛nancial gi˜ to 

the second generation members.
One member gave a testimony: ‚We could 
achieve something unimaginable in a coun
-try that persecutes True Parents: True Mother 

was welcomed at the airport with a red carpet! 
When we found out that this red carpet treat
-ment was possible, many of us were moved to 

tears. Why were we able to succeed? Only be
-cause we united totally with the directions of 

our European continental director president 
Yong Cheon Song. We took his directions very 

seriously, even though on the practical level 

they made no sense. We prayed hard and our 

national leader Marek Rudnik and elder brother 

Krzysztof Gago fought hard. And True Mother 

was welcomed as she should be™. 
President Song asked each member to bring 
ten guests and this made us much more serious. 

He also asked that the highest level VIPs in the 

nation should come and attend True Mother. 

Until the last minute Krzysztof Gago was on the 

phone with a desperate heart, reaching out to 

VIPs. Many German members came to Poland 

to bring guests. We were very grateful when we 

saw them o˘ering themselves joyfully for True 

Mother™s victory.
˝e national messiah, Beatrice Clyburn tes
-ti˛ed: ‚In preparation for True Mother™s visit 

we worked hard to get more Ambassadors for 
Peace. ˝e previous year we reached the goal 

of 500 Ambassadors. I felt strongly we had to 

set a seemingly impossible goal to mobilize the 

spiritual world. We united with the goal of 1000 

and succeeded the day be
 fore True Mother came™.

celebration, a˜er the main 

event in Warsaw, October 

24, 2005.Grzegorz Galacki, whose law ˛rm bears the 
interesting name of ﬁHananim & Galackiﬂ, led 
through the program. ˝e pre-program went 

quickly and soon True Father could take the 

stage and begin his speech. Frequently he was 

commenting on certain passages, mostly in 

English. He directly addressed the Polish peo
-ple several times, explaining about exchange 

marriage and elaborating on the signi˛cance 
that this day was also some commemorative 

day for the United Nations. He was full of vigor 

and stamina and stayed on the podium for over 

one and a half hours. At one point he said that 

he was feeling very close to the audience. ﬁYou 

may feel so close to me that you won™t want to 

leave me anymoreﬂ he said.
A˜er the speech True Mother came on the 
stage, smiling and beautiful as ever. ˝ey were 

given bouquets of ˚owers and a large trophy by 

a combination of Polish and German Ambassa
-dors for Peace, as a joint token of gratitude and 

congratulations. It was a very beautiful sight, 
True Parents with Pres. Song and the Peace 

Ambassadors posing with the trophy. ˝en, un
-
der large applause, True Parents le˜ the hall.
˝e program which followed was equally 
nice and interesting. First a German Ambassa
-dor for Peace, a long term friend and Bishop of 

the Mormon Church, expressed his dismay at 
the fact the True Parents can™t enter Germany: 

ﬁNobody understands this entry ban, when it is 

clear that Rev. Moon works for bringing peace 
and harmony among the nations, races and 

religions.ﬂ He could feel the Holy Spirit being 

present at this time and in this hall, urging all 

participants to join the work of Rev Moon in 

establishing God™s Kingdom on earth. - He was 

really on ˛re and thanked True Father frequent
-ly for his work.
Next came Christian Hausmann, who told the 
audience that he was feeling so light and exited 

since he had never been before a˜er completing 

his student years back in the 60ies. -
˝en, unexpectedly Imam Sajid from Great 
Britain took the podium and congratulated the 

Polish people on hosting such an event with 

True Parents. He himself would always refer to 

Father and Mother as True Parents. ﬁRev. and 

Mrs. Moon, the True Parents, bring this out in 

men, what was originally created to be in the 

image of Godﬂ, he remarked.
Finally Krzysztof Gago, the Secretary General 
of UPF Poland, took to the podium and, within 

3 minutes, explained all about the importance 

of love, three generations, four realms of heart 

and more. He is very well respected by the Pol
-ish Ambassadors for Peace.
˝e event ended with a beautiful, self made 
song by the STF and other 2nd Gen accompa
-nied by a guitar and a violin.
Brothers and sisters, thank you so much for you 
great support all around Europe, which made it 

possible that this event could be so successful!

522In this year the Polish Family Church could  
welcome the European Continental Represent
-ative President An Shik Young  the ˛rst time. 
Rev An started his visit in Cracow and travelled 
then to Warsaw and Gdansk. He gave precious 

guidance  about the Era of CIG we are living in. 
On Sunday October 12th  2014 the Polish 
Family Church celebrated that  it was then 40 

years ago that the Polish Uni˛cation Movement 

was founded. So the title of the event was: ‚40 

Years Uni˛cation Movement in Poland, 1974-

2014™. During a planning meeting for this cel
-ebration our deceased sister Harujo Gago had 

given these words from the Spirit World: ‚All 
that was done during these 40 years was out of 

love toward You, Heavenly Parent™. 
We celebrated this remarkable anniversary 
in the Peace Embassy in Warsaw. Prior to the 

celebration a 40 day prayer condition for pu
-ri˛cation and repentance was laid by brothers 

and sisters including 2nd Generation, and nu
-merous Polish brothers and sisters abroad. We 

had the honor of hosting True Parents™ Emis
-saries for Eastern Europe Dr. Moon Lan Young 

and Dr. Pak No Hi as special guests, together 
with Rev Rainer Fuchs, our sub-regional Leader 

from East Europe.
In July of the same year the Special Emissaries 

of True Mother,  Dr Moon Lan Young  and Dr. 

Pak No Hi honored us with their visit. ˝e deep 

heart relationship of Dr Moon and Dr Pak to 

True Parents and their guidance and prayers are 

a precious support for the mission in Poland.
Forty years ago on October 4, 1974 the Teach
-ing of the Divine Principle was brought to Com
-munist Poland through Janusz M. In the early 

eighties missionaries from Austria Œ ﬁ Butter˚y 
Mission ﬁ- entered Poland and a˜er the fall of 

the Berlin Wall other missionaries from France, 

Japan, Scandinavia and other nations arrived  in 

Poland. Together with Polish brothers and sis
-
ters they built the Foundation for True Parents 

of Heaven, Earth and Humankind in the Nation 
of Poland. 
˝e speci˛c situation of Poland was that for 
nearly ten years, until the crush of the Berlin 

Wall, two underground missionary groups were 

working independently not knowing about each 

other™s existence. One in the North, in Warsaw, 

centered on Janusz and Barbara M and one in 

the South, in Cracow, centered on Martha and 

Christoph Kral. ˝ere were also two other Aus
-trian missionaries working in Warsaw inde
-
pendently. A˜er the fall of communism these 

groups got united and Janusz  M became the 
˛rst National Leader of Poland. 
2014  President An visits Poland
2014  Celebration of ‚40 years Unification Movement in Poland™
40 years is a long time and the movement 
went through many di˙cult times, as if going 

through the wilderness. In order to remember 

the sacri˛ces from all missionaries, national 

messiahs and all Polish brothers & sisters, the 

Polish Movement did not only want to celebrate 

the 40 Year Anniversary, but also prepared a 

Special O˘ering Ceremony in order to o˘er to 

Heavenly Parent and True Parents of Heaven, 

Earth and Humankind all their sacri˛ces made 

and unconditional love invested in the nation 

of Poland. 
A large document was prepared with the ti
-tle ﬁO˘ering and Dedication to our Beloved 

Heavenly Parent and True Parents of Heaven, 
Earth and Humankindﬂ with the following 

words: ﬁWe, the undersigned Blessed families 

and brothers and sisters of the Polish Family 

Church hereby o˘er, with love and gratitude, 40 

years of dedication and sacri˛ce to spread God™s 

Word and Love for the building of His King
-dom in the Nation of Poland.
ﬁ˝e God of goodness is a God of sacri˛ce 
and love. When we re˚ect on our level of love, 

we ˛nd that we can measure it only on the scale 

of sacri˛ce.ﬂ CSG page 47, 11
All the guests and even smaller children 
signed this document which was then o˘ered 

by the current acting national leader, Martha 

Kral through a special o˘ering prayer in the 

O˘ering Ceremony. ˝e program included a 

presentation as the two main branches of the 

Polish movement in its early days: ˛rst of the 

Warsaw branch by Krzysztof Gago and then of 

the Butter˚y Mission from the former Butter˚y 

missionary Martha Kral.  A power point pres
-entation attempted to cover the most important 

events of the 40 year history. Of course songs 
and hymns were sung.  Even a famous Polish 

March from Polish Chief of State Jozef Pilsud
-ski was transformed into a ﬁMarszﬂ to honor the 

˛rst missionary work, with new words written 
by Wojtek Skonieczny.
˝e ˛nal closing was ushered by the speeches 
of our True Parents™ Emissaries Dr. Moon and 

Dr. Pak. ˝ey already brought a lot of changes in 

the atmosphere of our Polish movement and we 

o˜en feel the help and support of their prayers. 

When they are in Poland we experience strong
-ly the presence of True Parents through them.  
Dr. Moon said, ﬁI am so delighted to see 
you again. You make me feel that I have come 

home. In particular I am all the more honored 

and thankful to be part of this truly meaningful 

commemoration of the 40th Anniversary of the 

mission work in Poland.ﬂ
Dr. Pak shared the motto and guidance of 
True Mother, ﬁForgive, Love, Unite and always 

be gratefulﬂ. He said, ﬁFirst forgive yourselves, 

keep hand with your neighbor, say ‚I love you™, 

and then unite.ﬂ At this very moment, some
-thing amazing happened: our senior brother 

Janusz M, who was the ˛rst missionary, ar
-rived and joined us for the ˛rst time in almost 

18 years. All brothers and sisters stood up and 
welcomed him with a big applause; tearful hugs 

were exchanged and an amazing joy and uni
-ty ˛lled the sanctuary. It was like a miracle, not 

planned but guided by Heavenly Parent and 
True Parents. ˝is was the absolute and unex
-pected highlight; Janusz, who started the mis
-sion in Poland 40 years ago, arrived precisely at 

the right moment, at the end of the o˘ering and 
celebration of this forty year course. It was like 

the embracing of elder and younger brother.
A˜er lunch everyone had the chance to share 
their heart, sing songs etc. Our dear brother 

Janusz  related some of his ˛rst experiences in 

the early days of his mission, which moved us 

all very deeply.  Later other brothers and sisters 

shared, and a lot of tears were shed. ˝rough 

our tears the spirit of God was present. We all 

felt deeply, that these 40 years were brought to 

a victorious conclusion and that we were now 

able to look forward with hope to the second 40 

years and bring victory for Poland to our Heav
-enly Parent and True Parents of Heaven and 

Earth and Humankind.

525As the Uni˛cation movement in Poland is 
much younger than in the countries of West
-ern Europe, our 2 Generation children are also 
younger. ˝e ˛rst Blessing attended by a group 
of Polish brothers and sisters was 30,000 cou
-ples Blessing in 1992 (only several individual 

Polish members went to the previous Blessings), 
which means  that we had our ˛rst ﬁbaby-boomﬂ 

starting from 1996 and started some systematic 

education of the 2 generation around year 2000.
While our children were very young, we 
mainly organized Sunday schools  and short 

local workshops, but as children were growing 

we started making national workshops during 

school breaks ˛rst in the Church workshop 

center Glanow in Southern Poland, and later 

also in other places Œ Warsaw, Banie Mazursk
-ie in the Northern Poland, etc. Our ˛rst work
-shops and Sunday school meetings were mainly 
based on games, fairy-tales and various activi
-ties promoting Principle-based values, and later 

we developed more serious programs dedicat
-ed to direct study and practicing of the Prin
-ciple. We™ve also held workshops ﬁChildren of 

one Godﬂ where we presented to our children 
the core teachings of di˘erent religions and had 

some interfaith meetings with representatives 

of Judaism, Islam and Christianity.
As now we have over 100 blessed children, we 
have various regular programs adapted to di˘er
-ent age groups. Sunday school meetings for the 

youngest kids are o˜en led by our older 2 genera
-tion; we have regular workshops Œ monthly one-

day workshops in Warsaw, 7-day workshops in 
Banie Mazurskie in the summer, international 

winter 7-day workshop in Glanow plus several 

shorter workshops in spring and autumn. 
Education of Blessed Children
For the last several years we™ve been also or
-ganizing purity ring ceremonies for teenagers 

over 14 years of age so that to support them in 
their decision to follow the path of the Principle 

and keep their purity till the Blessing. 
Our most recent programs include  Divine 
Principle  study groups for teens over 16 years 

of age and service projects Œ during di˘erent 

seminars we had a program for the children 

from the orphanage, helped the dog shelter 

and cleaned the old German cemetery together 
with local young people. We™ve also had the ˛rst 

Blessing preparation workshop as many of our 

older teenagers are preparing for future match
-ing and Blessing.
We are very happy that our older 2 Generation 
are taking more and more responsibility, sup
-porting the workshops for their younger broth
-
ers and sisters as team-leaders, music and sport 

coordinators. We can really see how the e˘orts 
we™ve been investing in their education for the 

last 10-15 years are bringing beautiful results.

526527Testimonies
Twenty ˛ve years ago in November the Berlin 
Wall fell. ˝e time of divisions and persecutions 
in Europe and in the world ended and  com
-munism was coming to an end. At least these 

were my expectations.
˝e 80™s in Poland, thanks to Solidarnosc (Sol
-idarity,1980), gave me a lot of hope but also suf
-fering. On December 13th 1981 martial law was 
introduced in Poland and a new time of perse
-cution and su˘ering started. ˝ese years shaped 
the way I perceived the world around me. Even 

though I wasn™t a practicing Catholic, I felt that 

the Catholic church and its faith was like a Moth
-er who was protecting her children from dan
-gers and from the loss of identity. ˝e Catholic 
church, since the end of the Second World War, 

was a meeting place for all who - in an active or 

passive way - were resisting communism.
When I met Martha Kral in 1985 I saw in her 
a strong determination and a big heart full of 

love and service. A˜er getting to know the Di
-vine Principle I understood  where that strength 

and dedication came from. Many things that 
Martha was doing at that time were very dan
-In October 2005, when Rev. and Mrs. Moon 
were here in your city of Warsaw, I had the op
-portunity to meet them. And I can testify to you 

today the special feeling I had at that time: it 
was as if I had entered into a di˘erent world. 

˝e aura around Rev. Moon was full of peace 

and radiating like gold. It was not a normal 

peace but a pure and upli˜ing peace. Not the 

peace in someone who had destroyed all con
-
˚icts, but the peace of someone who did not 

know con˚icts any more. All disharmony was 
I joined the Uni˛cation Movement in 1983 in 
Warsaw. When I think of the movement in Po
-land I think about people who became a part 
of history. In my mind and heart I remember 

many people. Meeting and talking with them 

we can see the living history of our Polish move
-ment. If anyone is interested to learn more, 

please come to Poland. By meeting these people 
we can learn a lot. Books can™t tell as much. I 

am grateful to Heavenly Parent and True Par
-ents for all those people who made history. For 

their work and time which we o˘ered together 
and for the memories which will stay forever. I™d 

like to mention the names of the ˛rst ones who 

worked underground and built the foundation 

for future generations: 
Janusz and Barbara M, Zo˛a Huish, Lucyna 
Clarke, Krzysztof and Haruyo Gago, Bogu
 mila 
and Jacek Bem, Joanna Suzuki, Barbara Stacy, 

Elzbieta Zaremba, Maria and Slawomir Ro
-chowicz, Leszek Swerpel, Jan Twardowski.
In 1988 with the grace of Heavenly Parent and 
True Parents I met the Uni˛cation Church. ˝e 

very ˛rst meeting was in a co˘ee bar. At that 

time missionaries who worked underground in 

communist countries were very careful to invite 

anybody to the center. ˝ey had to verify a per
-son before they invited him. Later on I realized 

that prior to ˛nding a church member brothers 
and sisters had to make many conditions such 

as fasting, lecturing, prayers, many hours™ walks 

and 10-12 hours Divine Principle readings on a 

daily basis. Because we were students or we had 

jobs, this way of living was extremely di˙cult.
I am forever grateful for brothers and sisters™ 
sacri˛ces which helped me listen to the Divine 

Principle and hence make the commitment to 

follow True Parents as my Master of love. 
gerous, and many times she could have lost her 

freedom and her life. But she followed her ideal 

in spite of the risk. Especially in the ˛rst years, 

when I knew only Martha, the things she was 

saying and doing were my only reference point. 

˝e Divine Principle came from the Far East, 

but very quickly I identi˛ed myself with the 

Ideal that is expressed in it. Deep in my heart I 

had the desire for a better and fairer world, full 

of love for God - and from God.
I am grateful to all people I met at that time. 
˝ey were extraordinary people who believed 

truly and deeply in the realization of the Ideal, 

sacri˛cing their youth and life for God and oth
-ers. Each of them is a part of me. Each of them 

enriched me with their tears and joy, with their 
pain and doubts and, most of all, with their 

love and dedication. Today, there are still many 

problems in the world and each of us has to de
-cide if we want to build bridges that can unite 

people, or if we want to create walls that will 
separate us from one another.
˝ank you for everything!
like forgotten forever. Also all my fears and 

complexes were gone, and I felt only joy. When I 

shook their hands I was surprised: even though 

Rev. Moon™s hand was big and strong and Mrs. 

Moon™s hand was smaller and light, they emit
-ted the same frequency of love. I felt inside my 

heart so much love and protection.
I wish for all of us to build up such wonderful 
harmony, in our lives and in our marriage, as 

Rev. and Mrs. Moon.
˝ese people started the Polish Uni˛cation 
Movement in Warsaw. 
˝ere were many people who supported the 
movement like our parents, siblings, relatives, 

friends. Brothers and sisters mainly from the 

USA and France: Jerry and Teruyo Wolinski, 

Izabela Byrne, Grazyna Hagen who also helped

Polish language. 
In the 1980™s three Austrian sisters were sent 
on a mission to Poland. ˝ey worked under
-ground, risking their lives. In Cracow Martha 
Kral established a group and these are the ˛rst 

names of members who have forged the path 

for others to come. Mariola Tyrpa, Jadwiga K, 

Leszek Dziuba, Jerzy Dynowski, Renata Kopala, 

Stanislaw Glowacki, Jacek Czyszczon, Agniesz
-ka Pac, Malgorzata Bochnia, Grzegorz H, Jacek 
M. By the end of 1989 these groups became 

unit
 ed in one movement.
I admire brothers and sisters for showing me 
the way of love and attendance to True Parents, 

even though they had never had the chance to 

physically meet them. ˝is time we could only 

have True Parents™ picture, the Divine Princi
-ple, the support of spirit world and each other. 

Everything depended on prayer and conditions, 
since we couldn™t openly speak about True Par
-ents. Even fundraising, we did silently just with 

prayer. Because of conspiracy we were not al
-lowed to talk to any western brothers and sis
-ters while doing fundraising abroad. ˝is was 

painful. Sacri˛cing things which you loved the 
most was the tool to expand the foundation of 

our church. ˝ank you True Parents for allow
-
ing me to experience this unique time. ˝ank 

you for your love.

1974-2014  History of the Unification Movement in  Poland
We thank True Parents and everyone who contributed to make this history possible
True Father matched me in 1981 with Martha 
Rainer, one of the underground missionaries 
behind the iron curtain. In 1982 I attended with 

picture the 6000 Couple Blessing. A˜er some 

years of preparation I had to ˛nd my own way 

to go to Poland and join my wife. I had to o˙
-cially leave the Uni˛cation Church and found 
myself in underground too. I prayed every day, 

standing on the Vienna Reichsbrücke (bridge), 

with the hope that the Danube would carry my 

prayers to the communist nations. My wish was 

to ˛nd a job within an Austrian company doing 

business in Poland. Who wanted to work in a 

communist nation? Almost nobody, so it was 

quite an exotic plan. Right a˜er ˛nishing my 40 

day prayer condition I found a trading compa
-ny for printing machinery that was looking for 
a sales representative for Eastern Europe. 
During the ˛rst interview it was made very 
clear to me that this would be an extremely 

di˙cult job, full of loneliness, corruption and 

alcohol. A group of managers including the 

director asked me a lot of questions to test my 

quali˛cations. Honestly, I had no idea about 

printing machinery and I had no experience as 

sales manager. My only experience was fund
-raising. But I was so desperate to enter Poland 
that on every question I answered with great 

con˛dence, pretending that I was a specialist in 

every ˛eld. In the end all became silent and the 

director asked me one last question: ‚Mr. Kral, 

what is your weak point?™ In my desperation I 

exclaimed: ‚I have no week point!™ Everybody 

laughed and they dismissed me. Finding myself 

in the street again I was not sure if I would get 

this job. Two weeks later the company called me 

for making a very good business contract, and 

gave me the keys of a new Ford Sierra. 
My boss was a very experienced man who 
knew the market inside and out. Actually, in the 

beginning I was his suitcase carrier. We trav
-elled together for nearly a year (1986) to East 

Germany, Czchechoslovakia, Hungary and Po
-land. In that time it was a business tradition to 

invite customers for dinner, and drink alcohol 
with them all night long. From the very begin
-ning I made clear to them that I was not going 
to drink any alcohol. However, my boss pointed 

out to me that if I did not do so, I would not be 

able to do business in Eastern Europe.
My family background is one of no drinking, 
no gambling and not visiting bars. I was a very 

introvert person. Uni˛cation Church brothers 

and sisters said about me that I rarely spoke or 

smiled. Suddenly I found myself in such a situa
-tion. It was not possible to just sit silently with 
clients and not drink alcohol. I would have lost 

my job immediately. So God showed me a way. 

Ordering a Campari- Orange I asked the wait
 er not to stir it; then the red Campari stayed on 
the bottom and the orange juice on top. In this 

way I could sit the whole night in front of one 

glass and just drink the orange juice. But my 

most important job was to entertain the clients 

and create a joyful and exciting atmosphere. 

To be able to do that I had to deny my nature 

completely and become a di˘erent person. At 

the end of such a night, when we went back to 

the hotel everybody was drunk. I would be the 

only person sober. However, drunken people 

are very sensitive and feel judged easily, which 

was dangerous for the business relationship. So 

I had to hold arms with them and thus we tot
-tered down the streets. Sometimes I thought: 
‚If a Uni˛cation Church member would see me 

like this, he would never imagine that I am a 

member too™.
˝is went on for several months and the mo
-ment that I would be given the responsibil
-ity for Poland did not come any closer. Some 

months later our company was ˚ying to a sales 
fair in Moscow. During the ˚ight my boss told 

me that if I was be obedient and supportive to 

him, he would give me the chance to become 

responsible for Poland. I rejoiced internally and 

looked to the future full of hope. In Moscow 

my boss organized a big business meeting with 

Polish and Russian clients. A lot of jokes were 

told, amid plenty of alcohol. Suddenly my boss 

asked me in a loud voice in public: ‚What do 

you want to drink ?™ I knew that now the mo
-ment of judgment had come for me, and that all 
my investment was at stake. 
I was already so close to receive Poland as my 
sales country. I would just have to be ‚obedient™ 

and drink some alcohol, just once. But deep in
-side I felt the heart of God and I decided not 
to compromise. So I answered also in a loud 

voice ‚orange juice™. But my boss answered: ‚No, 

today you drink alcohol!™ But I insisted on or
-ange juice. All clients were looking at us. ˝ey 

were curious how this big Austrian business
-man was going to discipline his young green
-
horn. My boss and I looked into each other™s 

eyes and there was a complete silence for a few 
seconds. At that mo
 ment I knew that I might 
lose everything and might have to start again 

from the very begin
 ning. ˝en suddenly my 
boss said with his best dictator voice: ‚Ok, then 

you drink orange juice!™. He seemed to be okay 

with it, but I did not know for sure what was 

going to happen next.
Testimony of Christoph Kral
Two months later a big business deal showed 
up in Poland. My boss got sick and they had 

nobody to send over to (hopefully) sign this 

big contract of about 600.000 Swiss francs. Be
-cause they had no one else they sent me. Alone. 
My company was very afraid to make a big loss 

and they gave me many instructions on the way. 

˝ey even sent some e-mails to the customer to 

prepare for my visit. In those days all negotia
-tions were led by communist o˙cials and they 
were well trained to put all kind of pressure on 

you. But the negotiations went well and I sold 

it. Honestly, I did not know anything about this 
machine. A˜er signing the contract I sat down 

on a bench in the park and checked my docu
-ments to see what I had sold. When I returned to 
Austria my company was amazed how well I had 

done, and they gave me the sales responsibility 

for the whole of Poland. In this way I was able to 

join my wife in her underground mission.
In doing business in communist Poland I ex
-perienced the love of God deeply. One time I 

cried so much that I had to stop the car, because 
I could not see anything anymore. 
˝ank You Heavenly Parent and True Parents.
